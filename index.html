                    Alexa bot is developed to have the ability to adapt to the user's feelings and interact with it in the appropriate way, and this is the result of continuous dealing with the user, as you analyze all the texts that contain feelings and compare them with the old texts to know what the user feels and adapts to and with his needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bot can speak in both Arabic and English, as thanks to the fact that most of its users speak the Arabic language, the bot is able to learn the Arabic language and speak it well and its developers are still working to teach it more languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alexa bot uses a lot of open artificial intelligence sources, which makes it has a lot of ready experiences from other sources and develops and learns faster and Google is the company responsible for training the Alexa model next to the Alexa source, which is Golden.Eye.source who It was developed by NetBuilder Pro, owned by Mr. Omar Maher, all of these artificial intelligence sources make the bot a perfect and very strong model and thanks to other sources the source of Omar Maher develops quickly.
